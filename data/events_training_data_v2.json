Originally trained in drawing and painting, Chu worked as a draughtsperson at an architectural and engineering firm in Hong Kong before moving to Canada where, in 2011, he had a public art installation at Lansdowne Mall in Richmond, BC that serendipitously changed the trajectory of his art practice.\n\nAccording to Chu, \u201cInstallation art offers different dimensions as the viewers can walk through it, look at the work from different angles, through the spaces and experience the tension within the art pieces.\u201d Since 2014, Chu has been working on an ongoing series of works titled, Liu Shui, based on the Chinese pictographic words \u6d41 \u6c34 which translates as flowing water. This series is an installation consisting of a number of scrolls made of mixed media drawings and paintings using ink, drafting pens and water soluble oil pastels on tracing paper instead of more traditional materials such as silk or mulberry paper.\n\nSheer, light and translucent, the drawings and paintings as well as the tracing paper substrate have a diaphanous, delicate quality like water. Simultaneously, the works are textured with mysterious layers that veil and unveil with the rounded folds of the installation resembling the peaks and troughs of water ripples. Through Chu's work, the viewer is presented with the abstract, dynamic and sculptural qualities of \u201cflowing water\u201d.\n\nBorn in Hong Kong, Tony Yin Tak Chu moved to Canada in 1996. Soon after settling into Vancouver, Chu attended Langara College where he earned a Diploma in Fine Arts in 2004 and then went on to complete a Bachelor of Fine Arts majoring in Visual Arts in 2006 at Emily Carr Institute of Arts and Design. Since his graduation, Chu has had various solo and group exhibitions locally as well as in the United States and Mexico. He has also exhibited his work as public art in Vancouver and Richmond, and in the Toronto and Edmonton transit systems.\n\nGallery Hours:\nMonday-Friday 10am-6pm\nClosed Weekends and Holidays \n\nArt Beatus (Vancouver) Consultancy Ltd.\n108 - 808 Nelson Street, Vancouver BC\nt: 604.688.2633\nf: 604.688.2685\ninfo@artbeatus.com\nwww.artbeatus.com", "time_provided": false}, {"source-tags": ["Other"], "city": "Vancouver", "name": "Entry-Level Industry Workshop Series- 3D Animation + Visual Effects ", "venue": "VFS Animation & Visual Effects Campus", "detail": " Evolve Your Craft - Focused on adults seeking an exciting new career direction, this workshop series will initiate your journey towards advanced learning in the field of 3D Animation + Visual Effects.

In 2006 he received a BFA in Media Arts from Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design and, in 2008, an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He was also a postgraduate researcher at Jan Van Eyck Academie, Maastricht, the Netherlands, in 2013. He has had recent solo exhibitions at CAPC mus\u00e9e d\u2019art contemporain de Bordeaux; DAAD Galerie, Berlin (2017); and Gasworks, London (2015).

Through patterning and repetition, Busby's vivid floor-to-ceiling text painting makes these calls visible and persistent in the intellectual, social and bureaucratic life of SFU.\n\nThe work's title, WE CALL, abbreviates the address of each call to action to emphasize the mutual responsibility of the caller(s) to participate in enacting these structural shifts. In the coming year, Busby will collaborate with SFU faculty and students from disciplines frequently addressed in the document to talk about how they can take up the TRC's calls to action through curriculum, critical dialogue and engaged learning.\n\nWE CALL at the Teck Gallery parallels Busby's collaboration with the Gitksan Wet'suwet'en Education Society in Hazelton, BC to produce an iteration of the wall text painting on their campus.\n\nBusby is a Canadian artist and activist based in Vancouver.

This armour functions to \u201cprotect\u201c us against the pain of the Unexpressed or the Socially Unacceptable.\n\nBecause, through social repression, we have learned to associate feelings of expansion, joy and pleasure with the pain of rejection, shame and/or guilt, we learn to shut down by holding the breath, tensing muscles that would animate the impulse, and going numb. Ultimately, this physical constriction blocks contact to a point where sensations of increased excitement tend to trigger fear and tension rather than pleasure and letting go.\n\nBy contrast, Reich offers the term Orgasmic Potency: the ability to surrender to the sexual flow without block or inhibition. Reich held that full, healthy orgasm is only reached when partners who love each other can express that love AND when both partners are sufficiently free of armour \u2013 at least as regards the moment of union \u2013 that they can experience the involuntary muscular movements before climax that open the breathing and the pleasure.\n\nIn the Ontogonic Therapy approach, we work to unblock the body, liberating it from the impacts of earlier trauma and bringing awareness and acceptance to our personal histories.

Vancouver B.C for Lost Boys Series.\n\n \n\nFrancisco Diaz and Deb Young developed their photomontage series as a simulacrum of real life, with random photographs they put together to create a metaphorical story of growing up as a subversive act of life. The Lost Boys project starts as a conceptual artistic idea that talks about the process of becoming an adult, and it continues their interest in how childhood speaks so profoundly on who we will be as adults. It is storytelling about those particular times and moments just before our personality comes out, as we become an important and prominent part of society. We are all witnessing the emergence of our crossroads as the main point of our lives, but at that time we usually don\u2019t have to understand the mystery and insights of our transition. Sometimes, we are afraid of growing up because we find certain occasions as unknown, hard times, filled with dramatic moments. Inspired by escapism, controversy and mischievous stories of adventures and pranks of Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn and Peter Pan, Diaz & Young find their personal stories and lessons through The Lost Boys images, and turn the literature and fantasies into real life reaches of children\u2019s imagination.\n\n \n\nDiaz and Young start The Lost Boys project as a story where growing up is a subversive act of life. The Lost Boys series is a metaphorical look at collectivism and individualism as social and cultural syndromes. The fact is that the fundamental social conflict of Western culture today is an issue of individualism vs. collectivism. With photographic manipulation, Diaz and Young explore the visual language, reviewing evidence of childhood and adolescent gatherings in a group that behaves as a system that shares attitudes, beliefs, norms, roles, and values. We can identify with that because we do share languages, history, and places. There is a link between patterns of our personal life and life in the community. The thing is that humans are social animals. We live and do things together to improve our lives and survive. Does our life belong to us, or does it belong to the group, society, or the state? In expanding global politics and corporate businesses, we need clarity on this issue more than ever. Our children need that because sooner or later they could find they live in a dystopian world with a lack of personal freedom.\n\n \n\nDiaz & Young\u2019s narrative photomontages present fiction as real, an important visual dialog that encourages personal questioning and social discussion. They create a subjective and organized image that talks about the question of personal freedom we all have to fight for, but first of all, we have to teach our children to be free and open-minded. Sometimes, an innocent, wild and uncontrollable adventure, alone or with the bunch of friends, could be one of the more important lessons of life. Wild barefoot shore running sometimes helps in the process. One\u2019s face covered with mud, too. Seemingly unrelated, but Diaz and Young did the same thing with their collaboration. They imbue this series with the importance of transformation through self-reliance. The result is a multilayered story as a metaphor for the journey and experience of new ways of transitioning \u2013 personal or humankind. Even their artistic adventure starts with a leap of faith because their collaboration pushed to the edge the bare concept of photography. In their life and career, Diaz and Young believe that art is about conceptualizing an idea that can influence the viewer and help raise a positive attitude and the level of understanding the world.\n\n \n\nCultural, social and political influences on growing up are more important than we think. Today, growing up could be harder than ever, because people, in general, have become too lazy and too scared to live. We live online. Adulthood is awful, and the cruel real world is a scary place. Paralyzed with this horror, most people feel stressed and confused, trying to figure out what they could take out of life. Most of the would-be Peter Pans reconsider the meaning of adulthood before they have even lived their childhood because they live most of their real life in a virtual reality. Today, we have a society of totally infantile adults that \u201clost the map\u201d on the road to adulthood. Childhood is a time when we see and feel the world with our childish idealism, teens rebel against everything, and adult pragmatism is about our ability to balance idealism and pragmatism. This balance is the main framework of Diaz and Young\u2019s artistic statement. This issue is something that they point out to The Lost Boys images. They insist that growing up is about thinking, and this is the hardest and scariest part. Also, it is the most beautiful one.\n\n \n\nThe thing is that Francisco Diaz and Deb Young have that particular attitude on the subject. Their manipulated colour photography embraces an aesthetic of the 19th century Romantic Movement, including historical nostalgia, social injustices, nature and landscape painting that defined the main stage. The cultural evidence is more than visible. Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, Peter Pan, Harry Potter and even Alice Liddell are like-minded. A specific development in literature as in art affected the work of Diaz and Young. All those stories are about a journey and kids who go looking for adventure, action, imagination and personal experience. Like the kids of The Lost Boys series, all those characters present un-ruled places and spaces that were juxtaposed with confidence and curiosity. It is about the journey into new territory, basic instinct and the leap of faith. Diaz and Young\u2019s The Lost Boys series reminded me of the Lost Boys in Neverland and Peter Pan, at first sight. The Lost Boys are pre-teen boys who would not grow up. They enjoy the freedom and wild lifestyle. They are the boys \u201dwho fall out of their prams when the nurse is looking the other way\u201d (James Matthew Barrie, 1904) with a strong desire for a mother, without knowing what exactly a mother is.\n\n \n\nDiaz and Young\u2019s images today are more objective than ever. We live in times when lack of success has caused The Peter Pan Syndrome. He is everybody\u2019s hero. Thanks to Peter Pan and the Lost Boys most people love the fantasy of never ever growing old. He lures us into believing of never-never land. His eloquence in describing this great place of youth is quite inspirational. Images of a place and kids, who stayed forever young, have the sweet innocence of New Romanticism. People are fond of that kind of innocence. Peter Pan is not just a kid, but young men who refuse to grow up. Sometimes we all do this. He taught us that dreaming is good and friendship is not just a simple thing, love is pure and simple, and words are as important as actions. These kinds of hopelessly romantic attitudes exist in photos and remind us that showing affection needs actions as well as words. These concepts have both social and philosophical significance. Diaz and Young ask important questions about human behaviour and relationships in a most romantic way. They tell us that we have to explore the world like a child, and then we will see how beautiful it is.\n\n", "time": " 6-8 pm", "time_provided": true}, {"source-tags": ["Film", "Fundraisers & Charity"], "city": "Vancouver", "name": "Film Festival", "venue": "Langara College", "detail": " Join paddlers across the Lower Mainland to view this year's best paddling films.

These songs came together during our weekly residency in English Bay. Our band would change slightly every week and I became fascinated by how a different bass player or guitarist, or whether we had a trumpet or violin as the feature instrument, would influence the interpretation of the song. Every person playing with us would change the entire sound of our set list. It reminded me of how different the sea looks everyday. It\u2019s the same view yet so different. We love exploring these transient moments and wanted to capture that on this record!\u201d\n\nBlack Gardenia\u2019s musical pedigree speaks for itself. In her roles as leader of the band, half of acclaimed ukulele duo Ruby & Smith, and founder of Ruby\u2019s Ukes, the world\u2019s largest ukulele school outside Hawaii, Daphne has been profiled on CBC radio, on Shaw TV and The Province, Vancouver Sun, Georgia Straight, Ukulele Magazine, and the Vancouver Courier. On Lucky Star her captivating vocals have been paired with the talents of her musical (and life) partner, guitarist Andrew Smith, along with stellar musicians including Chris Davis (Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings), Paul Pigat (Cousin Harley), Stephen Nikleva and Jimmy Roy (Ray Condo and the Ricochets and Petunia and the Vipers), Cameron Wilson and Brent Gubbels (VanDjango), and Patrick Metzger (Headwater, Viper Central).\n\n\u201cWhen Chris Davis agreed to co-produce Lucky Star with me we sat down and picked the songs that really stood out to us, then specifically chose the musicians we wanted to would play on each song,\u201d continues Daphne. \u201cIt was an amazing experience to pick the sound and version we wanted first, and then orchestrate those musicians for the sessions. We found we heard things in the same way, which was quite magical.\n\u201cFor me, Lucky Star is the perfect musical cocktail. I\u2019ll have mine vintage with a twist!\u201d\n\nTrack Listing\n1.

They were more likely to be the subjects of research into an ethnographic present, always portrayed in exotic terms and without agency. Perhaps in reaction to earlier studies Indigenous people are among the critics of the work that anthropologists produce. Despite this troubled relationship Audra Simpson has adopted a discipline that exists to explore the human condition.\n\nThe current generation of anthropologists accept that research does not occur independent of the researcher\u2019s perspective. Thus, indigeneity will inevitably direct the course of inquiry for anthropology conducted by Indigenous people. In this conversation, Dr. Simpson will reflect upon her career as an anthropologist. She will discuss the tropes, trends and themes that inform her research and how she contributes to the discourse of modern anthropology.\n\nAudra Simpson will be in conversation with Eldon Yellowhorn.\n\nSpeaker Bio\nAudra Simpson is a Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University. She is the author of Mohawk Interruptus by Duke University Press and a coeditor, with Andrea Smith, of Theorizing Native Studies.\n\n\"My primary research is energized by the problem of recognition, by its passage beyond (and below) the aegis of the state into the grounded field of political self-designation, self-description and subjectivity. This work is motivated by the struggle of Kahnawake Mohawks to find the proper way to afford political recognition to each other, their struggle to do this in different places and spaces and the challenges of formulating membership against a history of colonial impositions. As a result of this ethnographic engagement I am interested especially in those formations of citizenship and nationhood that occur in spite of state power and imposition and in particular, I am interested in declarative and practice-oriented acts of independence. In order to stay faithful to the words of my interlocutors I am interested as well in the use of narrative as data, in alternative forms of ethnographic writing and in critical forms of history. In order to stay faithful to my own wishes, I work at every turn to enter the fields of anthropology and Native American Studies into a critical and constructive dialogue with each other.\n\nMy second research project examines the borders of time, history and bodies across and within what is now understood to be the United States and Canada.\"\n\nFind out more about the work of our partners & join the online discussion in SFU's Vancity Office of Community Engagement Facebook group!", "time": " 7 pm", "time_provided": true}, {"source-tags": ["Concerts", "Food & Drink"], "city": "Vancouver", "name": "Mutt + Omianan + Lou Garou", "venue": "LanaLou's Restaurant", "detail": " Shake, rattle and despair young friends; Reagan Mutt is bringing his doom folk to Lanalous.\nJoin Reagan Mutt, Omianan and Lou Garou for a whimsical Wednesday night.\n\nReagan Mutt:\nhttps://reaganmutt.bandcamp.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/reaganmutt/\n\nOmianan:\nhttps://omianan.bandcamp.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/omianan/\n\nLou Garou\n\nCover: $10 \nLicensed/All ages venue", "time": " 7:30-11 pm", "time_provided": true}, {"source-tags": ["Concerts"], "city": "Vancouver", "name": "Songbirds & Sinners", "venue": "WISE Hall", "detail": " Join Blues Cabaret Chanteuse Ana Bon Bon, the first lady of queer country Cindy Emch (Secret Emchy Society), and torch song singer Yours Truly, Michele for an intimate night of rootsy americana music on Wednesday March 21st at 8pm. It\u2019s going to be a boot stompin\u2019 heart breakin\u2019 triple twang line up of intoxicating western cabaret at the WISE Hall, not to be missed.\n\nHow did a couple of ladies from California come to find themselves playing at one of the finest venues in Vancouver along with local treasure Ana Bon Bon? The story goes like this: Still sporting a heady high from her previous show at the Accordion Noir Festival in the fall of 2017 - Cindy Emch (Secret Emchy Society) and Michele Kappel (Yours Truly, Michele) were planning the route for their 2018 Songbirds & Sinners tour, and Cindy knew that they needed to come back to her Vancouver home away from home - The WISE Hall - where she has played previously with Carolyn Mark, Hank Pine, Kitty & the Rooster, and the Creaking Planks. The stars aligned when Ana Bon Bon - whom Emch had shared a Victoria stage with back in 2016 - was available for the show, and the three women knew they had some truly extra special twang up their sleeve for the night. \u201c\u2026the last time we [Emch & Bon Bon] played together we had so much fun I broke her accordion. Who knows what could happen this time around!\u201d - Cindy Emch\n\nSECRET EMCHY SOCIETY\nCindy Emch from Oakland, CA is the \u201cEmchy\u201d at the heart of the \u201cSecret Emchy Society.\u201d She writes and performs cowboy songs, drinking tunes, and old-school country music. In 2017 she was named by Huffington Post as the \u201cFirst Lady of Queer Country,\u201d by TheBoot.com as one of the Top 10 Queer Country Artists to check out for REAL country music fans, and had her 2017 debut album listed by the Atlanta Auditory Association as on of the top 50 of the year. As a fixture of seminal Bay-area Americana-inflected bands such as Vagabondage, Rhubarb Whiskey and The Oakland Wine Drinker\u2019s Union,\u00a0and former Accordion Babe, Emch is touring to support her new album \u2018The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville\u2019 which was recorded in Victoria, BC and features Carolyn Mark, Tolan McNeil, Grayson Walker, and more. \n\nYOURS TRULY, MICHELE\nYours Truly, Michele, may best capture the heady mix of influences and experiences she can bring to any party simply by showing up. With a sound infused with 60s pop, shadowy torch songs, and touched by Americana Roots-Rock, it is truly Michele Kappel\u2019s own brand of music. She co-founded the Garage-Pop Alt Rock band The Kirby Grips (Sympathy For The Record Industry), performing behind the drum kit on national stages including at Noise Pop and CMJ. When The Kirby Grips paused for an indefinite amount of time, Kappel created ukulele-toting folk pop artist Tippy Canoe and started writing her own melody-rich songs, inspired by influences as diverse as Squeeze, Ray Price, and the Spector Wall of Sound. More recently, Kappel incarnated as one-half of the close-harmony, country-tinged, impeccably decked out duo, Heartache Sisters and was behind the drum kit with classic country band Laura Benitez & the Heartache. YTM, however, puts Kappel\u2019s style, substance and well-honed musical sensibilities front and center. \u201cNo matter your mood, you\u2019ll walk away with a smile. It\u2019s cheaper than therapy.\" Tony DuShane at The San Francisco Chronicle wrote of a YTM performance, which by turns can evoke Debbie Harry, Erin McKeown, and Patsy Cline. \n\nANA BON BON\nThe \u201cexotic prairie gospel\u201d of Ana Bon Bon is not to be missed.

The early feedback on the live shows was clear: lose the sketches. So the songs endured and they all remain because the band hates to throw anything out. The songs were written to make fun of a big dumb world. Luckily, the world is still dumb and The Arrogant Worms (Mike McCormick, Chris Patterson and Trevor Strong) still have plenty to sing about. The shows are fast, furious and family friendly. The wit is quick, the satire is biting and the musicianship is second to none. Their appeal has earned them fans from kids to parents to grandparents to Princess Leia. The Arrogant Worms have sold more than 160,000 copies of their 14 albums. The band has played on three continents to crowds as large as 100,000 and were recognized in 2003 as the Touring Act of the Year by the Canadian Arts Presenters Association. The Worms have entertained at corporate functions, sung anthems at sporting events and emceed at major festivals. Their songs are in school lesson plans, in textbooks and even played on the Space Shuttle. On earth or in space, everyone digs these Worms. Over a quarter century after they began, The Arrogant Worms continue to provide tuneful and silly escapism for everyone who needs it. And if you think you don\u2019t need it, well you\u2019re wrong. You do.

His research employs genome engineering in inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) to study genetic diseases. These iPS cells can be generated from any cell in the body, typically from skin or blood cells, that can then be coaxed to mature into any cell type of the human body. The process of reprogramming mature cells into iPS cells earned Sir John B. Gurdon and CiRA's Shinya Yamanaka the Nobel Prize in 2012.\n\nDr. Woltjen uses iPS cells to study cells in the lab which we could not gain access to in patients, such as brain cells. By generating the mature cell type from a patient with a genetic disease, his lab can study the consequences of the disease, screens for drugs which may help the patient, and even try to make positive changes to the DNA, using genomic engineering techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9, to ultimately repair the cause of the genetic disease.", "time": " 7 pm", "time_provided": true}, {"source-tags": ["Concerts"], "city": "Vancouver", "name": "Ministry", "venue": "Vogue Theatre", "detail": " American industrial-metal band tours in support of upcoming album AmeriKKKant, with guest Chelsea Wolfe.", "time": " doors 7 pm", "time_provided": true}, {"source-tags": ["Concerts"], "city": "Vancouver", "name": "54-40", "venue": "Abbotsford Arts Centre", "detail": " Canadian alt-rock band (\"Ocean Pearl\", \"One Gun\") performs their hits.", "time": " 7:30 pm", "time_provided": true}, {"source-tags": ["Film", "Activism"], "city": "Vancouver", "name": "Reel Causes: #WorthFightingFor", "venue": "Djavad Mowafaghian Cinema", "detail": " #WORTHFIGHTINGFOR: ENVIRONMENTAL SHORT FILMS\n\nHunting Giants, Water Warriors and more.\n\nOn March 29th Reel Causes and Wilderness Committee are pleased to present #WorthFightingFor, an evening of film and conversation to raise awareness about the value and fragility of our environment.

Set in the formerly prosperous town of Port Renfrew, Hunting Giants is told through the point-of-view of the residents, the local indigenous community, and a group of big tree climbers.\n\nHunting Giants is a cinematic adventure into the old-growth rainforests of British Columbia that asks a question faced by resource communities around the world: extract profit until nothing remains or risk everything in pursuit of a more sustainable future?\n\n\nWater Warriors\nMICHAEL PREMO | 22 MINS\nWater Warriors is the story of a community\u2019s successful fight to protect their water from the oil and natural gas industry. In 2013, Texas-based SWN Resources arrived in New Brunswick, Canada to explore for natural gas. The region is known for its forestry, farming and fishing industries, which are both commercial and small-scale subsistence operations that rural communities depend on. In response, a multicultural group of unlikely warriors\u2013including members of the Mi\u2019kmaq Elsipogtog First Nation, French-speaking Acadians and white, English-speaking families\u2013set up a series of road blockades, preventing exploration. After months of resistance, their efforts not only halted drilling; they elected a new government and won an indefinite moratorium on fracking in the province.\n\nWater Warriors invites audiences to contemplate and re-imagine their own possibilities for resistance.\n\nScreening followed by a Q&A with filmmakers and environmental activists.\n\n\nTHE CAUSE\n\nWilderness Committee, founded in 1980, is a registered non-profit society with charitable status. The Wilderness Committee is Canada\u2019s people-powered, citizen-funded wilderness protection group. They have more than 60,000 supporters, volunteers and activists from coast to coast to coast working together to preserve wilderness, protect wildlife, defend parks, safeguard public resources and fight for a stable and healthy climate.\n\nAmong its many initiatives, The Wilderness Committee has surveyed and cleared wilderness trails (a unique campaign strategy) in imminently threatened wilderness areas, including Meares Island, the Stein Valley, Carmanah Valley, the Boise Valley, Clayoquot Valley, Flores Island and the Stoltmann Wilderness. These trails have kept logging at bay while providing access for scientists, photographers and wilderness activists. In a unique effort to help train and educate youth in trail building and eco-tourism, the Wilderness Committee partnered with Ahousaht First Nations in a Youth Services Canada-funded project to survey and build an 11 km long hiking route, the Ahousaht Wild Side Heritage Trail.\n\nFind out more about the work of our partners & join the online discussion in SFU's Vancity Office of Community Engagement Facebook group!", "time": " 7:30 pm", "time_provided": true}, {"source-tags": ["Performing Arts"], "city": "Vancouver", "name": "Flora Fauna", "venue": "The Flamingo", "detail": " Dodi has had years opera training, can play few instruments including: guitar, piano and banjo.
