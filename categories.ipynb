    "Looking at the examples from above we could just use tags to describe our events. Based on the tags we can then group our events. Events with the tag: Fine Arts, Comedy, Painting, Theatre, Musical or Dance can then be grouped as Arts. This also means that we don't have to keep track of the category in our data set. We just need to specify which tags make up a category. So instead of trying to come up with the category, we just need to come up with the number of tags that match with the given features (detail, name, venue, time, ...)"
